# benchmark_ccl_cosmosis_class

This notebook makes a simple benchmark for the calculation of the matter power spectrum 
and angular power spectrum of three libraries:
* [Cosmosis](https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/cosmosis/wiki/Home)
* [CLASS](https://lesgourg.github.io/class_public/class.html)
* [CCL](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL)

The original was by written by Danielle Leonard but has been extended to run CLASS
within it and show COSMOSIS output as well

## Dependencies
